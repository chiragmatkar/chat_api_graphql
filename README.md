# chat_api_graphql


## We will build a GraphQL API that allows users to message each other. 

The goal is to implement the following:

A mutation to create a new user. A user will have a user_id and a username.
A mutation to create a new message. A message will have a sender and a recipient.
A query to retrieve the user_id of a user given its username.
A query to list all the messages addressed to a user.
A subscription that sends new messages to subscribed clients when they are created.


# Test Subscription
Letâ€™s begin by creating two users, user_one and user_two. Paste the following mutation and hit play.

```
mutation {
  createUser(username:"user_one") {
    success
    user {
      userId
      username
    }
  }
}
```
```
mutation {
  createUser(username:"user_one") {
    success
    user {
      userId
      username
    }
  }
}
```

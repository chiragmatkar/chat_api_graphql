# chat_api_graphql


## We will build a GraphQL API that allows users to message each other. 

The goal is to implement the following:

A mutation to create a new user. A user will have a user_id and a username.
A mutation to create a new message. A message will have a sender and a recipient.
A query to retrieve the user_id of a user given its username.
A query to list all the messages addressed to a user.
A subscription that sends new messages to subscribed clients when they are created.
